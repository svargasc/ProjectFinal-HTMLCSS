        <h1>Why do we like horror movies</h1>
        <p>
            If something is clear, it is that a large sector of the population likes horror movies. But why do they come
            to like horror movies? The sensations associated with fear are not usually associated with pleasure, but
            rather the opposite: fear is produced by a physiological response that appears when the chances of seeing
            our life threatened by some danger are relatively high and, therefore, we learn to avoid it. However, in the
            cinema, people invest money and time in being exposed to situations that produce terror. Why is this
            happening?

            Many may come to think that it is due to a lack of empathy or sadism of the person who is politically
            incorrect and that, once a year, it can come to light. However, there are theories that go beyond this
            vision.

        <h1>The best horror movies in cinema history</h1>
        <p>
            To make the list of the fifty best horror films in the history of cinema, we have consulted a large group of
            film festival programmers, critics, essayists and others specialized in genre cinema. The resulting list, of
            course, will not satisfy everyone equally -for example, none of the films mentioned in this introduction
            appear on it-, this is what happens in this type of voting that, regardless of the affiliations of each one,
            what always ends up triumphing is the general consensus.

                    one that can surprise the most to an analyst. It is a little-known film but "essential" according to
                    Eude, especially if you are a lover of horror movies. For the freestyler, what surprises the most
                    are "his plot twists" because "it surprises you more and more."</td>

                    people. It has a very strong social background and that makes it very interesting," explains the

                    itself, supposedly, was a true story, since the production company even created a blog where it

                    an Oscar in 2017 for Best Original Screenplay and its importance is crucial, since it is only the
                    sixth horror film nominated for the most prestigious statuette in the industry in all of history.

                    format, because it is too terrifying. Surely you have ever seen the viral scene of the devilish girl
