                    <p>
                        The horror film genre has existed as a genre since <strong><em>the mid-1930s.</em></strong> In its beginnings, this genre was
                        greatly
                        influenced by the Gothic literature of authors such as Bram Stoker, Allan Poe or Mary Shelley. Basing
                        itself
                        on this literature for its creation was a success, since cinema is the perfect medium to capture all the
                        characteristics of Gothic literature.
        
                        As for the genre in the cinema, obviously one of the characteristics of the horror genre is to scare the
                        viewer . Although it seems obvious from the point of view we have today, the simple fact of going to see
                        a
                        movie at the cinema today acquires a totally different concept from almost a century ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the mid-30s of the last century, going to the movies to be scared was a mission that not everyone was
                        capable of doing. There were even times when movie theaters were left half empty when spectators fled in
                        terror.
        
                        Despite this, the first horror films were a complete success among the public , their popular acceptance
                        being instantaneous and the foundations of the genre being established very soon. Due to the success of
                        these horror films, some studios (especially Universal ) realized the commercial success of these films
                        and
                        it was here that the history of horror films began .

                    <p>
                        Normally, the plots of horror movies revolve around the appearance of an "evil" force that terrifies the
                        protagonists and they must fight against adversity to save themselves. Over the decades, the genre has
                        evolved, emerging numerous subgenres of horror movies such as:

                        The antecedents of horror movies come from, as we have said in the introduction, the horror novel. In
                        addition to these novels that were born in the second half of the 18th century, previously there was
                        already
                        a tradition of scary tales passed down from generation to generation. A highly developed tradition in
                        rural
                        cultures around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we stick to the strictly cinematographic, it can be said that the first film in history was also a
                        horror
                        film. We are talking about the film by the Lumière brothers, L'arrivée d'un train à La Ciotat (The
                        arrival
                        of the train at Ciotat station) from 1896 . This film caused great terror in the spectators, the cinema
                        was
                        a new invention and when they saw the train that was approaching, the public believed that it was going
                        to
                        leave the screen to run over them. It can be said that, then, cinema has been linked to terror since its
                        inception. Since, even if it is a minimum, we give the cinema more credibility than the books.

                    <p>
                        In 1923,<strong><em> Universal Pictures</em></strong> began producing films with horror and gothic elements. The protagonist of
                        almost
                        all of these films was Lon Chaney , who soon became a benchmark in horror movies thanks to his
                        avant-garde
                        makeup and his talent. The three dark icons of his filmography are The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) ,
                        The
                        Phantom of the Opera (1925) and London After Midnight (1927) , perhaps the most legendary and
                        influential
                        lost film of all time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first film in the series was The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In this film Lon Chaney surprised the
                        world
                        with his performance and characterization as the hunchback Quasimodo (you can see the image below). It
                        would
                        be an adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel that Alice Guy already adapted in 1905. Two years later, in
                        1925,
                        Chaney would star in The Phantom of the Opera . Which is considered one of the best adaptations of
                        Gastón
                        Leroux's novel and also one of the best interpretations of Chaney.

                        In the 1930s, Universal Pictures continued to produce films based on gothic horror literature. And it
                        laid
                        the foundation for what would become the horror film genre . In this decade, the studio produced several
                        films featuring the most iconic monsters in movie history: Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The
                        Invisible
                        Man, and The Wolf Man.

                        Terror and the cult is something that has gone hand in hand since the very existence of the genre , and
                        it
                        is not only the hegemony of the genre of the seventies and eighties (which is when the label itself
                        takes
                        more prominence). You just have to take a look at the first milestones of horror in the cinema, which
                        would
                        achieve that classification for all the influence they had and the indisputable legacy they generated
                        for
                        filmmakers and subsequent currents.

                        Already in the early twenties, ' The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari ' and ' Nosferatu ' are not only the two
                        great totems of terror that few dare to question , but also become the object of deserved worship that,
                        almost a century after its existence remains impassive to the passage of time. A decade later , and
                        almost
                        always associated with what would come to be understood as series B, the other genre films attached to
                        this
                        category would come from filmmakers like Tod Browning or James Whale , who with ' The monster stop ' and
                        '
                        Doctor Frankenstein' set a chair in terms of the conception of terror on screen is concerned.

                        of the genre through the decades, we choose the ten films that from 1941 to 1958 ended up being horror
                        stories , and that despite to the fact that they have not yet managed to be considered classics (some of
                        them are by definition, such as the case of 'The Wolf Man ' or ' The Woman and the Monster ' from
                        Universal), they have transcended and been of such influence that they are worth saving

                        The 70s was the decade where the great blockbusters of the genre were created in the modern era and many
                        of
                        these films have come down to us as horror film references today. Movies like The Texas Chainsaw
                        Massacre
                        (1974), The Exorcist (1973) or The Prophecy (1976) give an account of this. Also in the 1970s, the works
                        of
                        horror author Stephen King began to be adapted for the big screen, beginning with Brian De Palma's
                        adaptation of Carrie (1976) , King's first published novel, in which the two protagonists female ( Sissy
                        Spacek and Piper Laurie) earned Oscar nominations. His third published novel would be the basis for
                        Stanley
                        Kubrick to create The Shining (1980) . At that time the film was a critical and public failure but over
                        time
                        it has become one of the most iconic films in the horror genre .

                    <p>
                        In Spain, films of the genre were also made, and Who can kill a child? (1976) by Chicho Ibáñez Serrador
                        is
                        an example. Also noteworthy in Italy is Dario Argento with Suspiria (1977) and in Japan, Hausu (1977) ,
                        a
                        kind of most original and surreal terrifying comedy that horror movies have produced. Already entered
                        the
                        eighties, the genre would be filled with increasingly violent and bloody films where a psychopath
                        persecuted
                        the protagonists ( Slasher subgenre that we will see later). These types of films will continue to be
                        made
                        for decades to come. Films like Friday the 13th (1980),A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), or Hellraiser
